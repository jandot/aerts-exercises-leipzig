* Find out what the different tables are in the database, and what they look like.
    Should use .tables, "select * from some-tables limit 2", ...

* How many genes have no location?
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM genes WHERE location IS NULL;

* How many distinct omim genes are mentioned in the gene table?
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT omim FROM genes);

* What is the gene with the most probesets?
    SELECT gene_id, COUNT(*) AS c FROM probesets GROUP BY gene_id ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 10;
    => gene with gene_id 2447 has 34 probes
    SELECT * FROM genes WHERE id = 2447;
    => gene is ABP1
* Recreate (a version of) the AffyAnnotation.clean file (i.e. a table with these columns: probeset_id, gene_symbol, location, ensembl, omim, sample_name, expression).
    SELECT p.name, g.symbol, g.location, g.ensembl, g.omim, s.name, e.value
    FROM probesets p, genes g, samples s, expressions e
    WHERE p.gene_id = g.id
    AND e.probeset_id = p.id
    AND e.sample_id = s.id
    LIMIT 10;
